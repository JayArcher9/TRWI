Genetic Algorithm for Biometric Image Encryption Optimization
This project focuses on optimizing the parameters of a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate encrypted biometric images. The aim is to create cancelable biometric templates with high accuracy by fine-tuning the GA's crossover and mutation rates.

Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

Generate Initial Population: Create an initial population of encrypted biometric images using multiple rounds of XOR encryption with random keys.
Optimize GA Parameters: Use the genetic algorithm to optimize the crossover and mutation rates for generating cancelable biometric templates.
Evaluate Accuracy: Evaluate the accuracy of the cancelable templates generated by the GA.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/JayArcher9/TRWI.git
cd ga-biometric-encryption
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
Usage
Place the original biometric image in the project directory. The image should be named download.jpg.
Run the main script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will generate initial encrypted images and optimize the GA parameters, printing the accuracy scores for each combination of crossover and mutation rates.
Project Structure
main.py: Main script to execute the project.
generate_initial_population: Function to generate initial population images using multiple rounds of encryption.
optimize_ga_parameters: Function to optimize GA parameters (crossover and mutation rates).
evaluate_population, select_parents, crossover_and_mutate, crossover, mutate, next_generation: Helper functions for GA operations.
Functions Description
generate_initial_population(original_biometric_image, num_images, num_rounds)
Generates an initial population of encrypted biometric images using XOR encryption.

Parameters:

original_biometric_image: The original biometric image.
num_images: Number of initial population images to generate.
num_rounds: Number of encryption rounds.
Returns:

initial_population: List of encrypted images.
optimize_ga_parameters(initial_population)
Optimizes the genetic algorithm parameters (crossover and mutation rates) to find the best cancelable template.

Parameters:

initial_population: Initial population of encrypted images.
Returns:

accuracy_scores: Dictionary containing accuracy scores for each combination of crossover and mutation rates.
Helper Functions
evaluate_population(population): Evaluates the fitness of each cancelable template in the population.
select_parents(population, fitness_scores): Selects parent cancelable templates for reproduction based on fitness scores.
crossover_and_mutate(parents, crossover_rate, mutation_rate): Performs crossover and mutation operations on the parent cancelable templates.
crossover(parent1, parent2): Performs crossover operation on two parent cancelable templates.
mutate(individual, mutation_rate): Performs mutation operation on a cancelable template.
next_generation(population, offspring, fitness_scores, offspring_fitness): Combines the offspring and parents, and selects the fittest individuals for the next generation.
